## 🔗 Technical Implementation

### Automatic Registration Process:
```javascript
// When user connects wallet
const account = await connectWallet();

// User confirms registration
const confirmed = confirm("Share wallet address with admin?");

if (confirmed) {
  // Auto-register with smart contract
  await contract.solicitarTokensIniciales();
  // User now appears in admin voter list
}
```

- Admin can query all registered voters
- Token distribution uses registered voter list

- Transparent transaction history
- Smart contract security
- MetaMask wallet security

### Returning User:
1. **Visits voting page** → Wallet auto-connects
